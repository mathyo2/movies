 <h1 class="ss"><b>Movies and their impact on the viewer</b></h1>
 <h2 class="ee">Movies and acting are powerful forms of art that entertain, inspire, and influence people worldwide.
     Through storytelling, films capture emotions, cultures, and ideas, making them a universal language. Acting brings
      characters to life, allowing audiences to connect with different experiences and perspectives. Whether through drama, comedy,
       or action, movies have the ability to evoke strong emotions and provoke thought.

Films also play a significant role in shaping society. They can raise awareness about important

 issues, challenge stereotypes, and inspire change. For example, movies about historical events
  educate viewers, while romantic comedies often reflect societal values. Additionally, films can
   influence fashion, language, and even personal beliefs. A great movie can leave a lasting impact,
    motivating people to pursue their dreams or see the world differently.

However, movies can also have negative effects, such as promoting violence or unrealistic standards. It 
is important for viewers to critically analyze what they watch. Overall, the film industry is a powerful tool 
that entertains, educates, and shapes the way people think, making it an essential part of modern culture.</h2>

<h1><i> 1) vito corleone :the Godfather I</i></h1>
<pre><h3>
    Vito Corleone, the iconic protagonist of The Godfather,
    is a powerful and complex Mafia leader.
    Known as the "Don," he commands respect through a mix of wisdom,
    ruthlessness, and loyalty to family.
    Unlike typical gangsters, Vito operates by a strict moral code,
     believing in favors and reciprocity—
    "I’ll make him an offer he can’t refuse.
    " His journey from a poor Sicilian immigrant to a feared New York
    crime boss highlights themes of power,
    survival, and corruption. Despite his criminal dealings
    Vito values honor and protects those he loves,
    making him both a villain and a tragic figure.
    His legacy defines the Corleone family’s rise and fall.</h3>

        Tony Montana,
        the iconic protagonist of Scarface (1983),
        is a ruthless Cuban immigrant who rises to
         power in Miami’s drug underworld.
        Driven by ambition and greed,
         he builds a criminal empire,
          declaring, "The world is yours."
        His violent temper, paranoia,
        and obsession with control lead
         to his downfall. Despite his brutality,
        Tony’s charisma and tragic
         arc make him a compelling antihero.
         The character,
        played by Al Pacino,
        symbolizes
         the dark side of the American Dream—unchecked
          ambition and moral decay.
        With his memorable quotes and explosive fate,
        Tony Montana remains one of cinema’s
         most unforgettable figures.

    <section class="rtrt">
 <h3 style="color: black;"
   ><pre style="color: black;">
        Tyler Durden, the charismatic and anarchic protagonist of Fight Club, embodies
        rebellion against consumerism and societal conformity.
        A split personality of the unnamed narrator,
        Tyler is bold, destructive,
        and philosophically radical,
        pushing men to reclaim masculinity through violence and chaos.
        His mantra—“You are not your job,
        not your money,
        not your car”—challenges modern identity constructs.
        As the leader of Fight Club and Project Mayhem,
        Tyler orchestrates societal disruption,
        blurring the lines between liberation and tyranny.
        Though charismatic,
        his nihilistic ideals expose
        the dangers of unchecked extremism.
        Tyler’s duality—both liberator and terrorist—makes
        him a compelling critique
        of modern 
        disillusionment and identity crises.
